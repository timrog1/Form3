# \<payments\>

Payments viewer demo

A demonstration implemented using Polyer Web Components, and a stub data server hosted in Node.

## Installation

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Running in browser

```
$ npm start
```

## Running tests

```
$ npm test
```

## TODO list
1. Test in other browsers (only tested in Chrome so far)
2. Create some more representative stub data (all the records supplied were the same).
3. Create contract tests (using e.g. Pact) to ensure contracts maintained between client and server.
4. Make the endpoint of the server configurable.
5. Make it prettier.
